This project predicts the price of laptops based on their specifications using Machine Learning regression techniques.
The goal is to help users estimate laptop prices based on features like brand, RAM, storage, processor, etc.

 # Problem Statement

Laptop prices vary widely depending on specifications.
Manually estimating a fair price is difficult.
This project uses machine learning to predict laptop prices accurately from given features.

# Dataset

Dataset contains laptop specifications such as:

Brand

RAM

Storage

Processor

Operating System

Screen size (if available)

Target variable: Laptop Price

(Dataset used for learning and practice purposes)

# Technologies Used

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

# Machine Learning Approach
