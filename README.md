This project predicts the price of laptops based on their specifications using Machine Learning regression techniques.
The goal is to help users estimate laptop prices based on features like brand, RAM, storage, processor, etc.

🧠 Problem Statement

Laptop prices vary widely depending on specifications.
Manually estimating a fair price is difficult.
This project uses machine learning to predict laptop prices accurately from given features.
